# 555 Final Dashboard

# Introduction
This dashboard explores how **gastrointestinal (GI) transit times** relate to **body composition** and **gender/BMI differences**.

-Obesity is associated with gastrointestinal motility disorders across the GI tract.

-Excess visceral adipose tissue and other ectopic fat deposits are positively associated with gastrointestinal malignancies.  

-Gastric emptying is the process in which the contents of the stomach move into the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine.

-There are some data that report an accelerated gastric emptying rate among overweight and obese adults as compared to lean counterparts, but the data are scarce and inconsistent.


### Data Set
This project uses Smart Pill Gastric motility device and Dual-Energy X-ray Absoptiometry data from the Legume Diet Feeding Study (the data is confidential at this time), which has 60 participants, 30 of which completed the Smart Pill assessment at Baseline. Key variables include Gastric Emptying Time (hh:mm:ss), Colonic Transit Time (hh:mm:ss),, Whole Gut Transit time (hh:mm:ss), Visceral Adipose Tissue (KG), Android-Gynoid Ratio, Waist Circumference (CM),  Moderate-vigorous physical Activity (MET-hours, weekly), age, gender, and race. The study population included men and women between the ages of 40 to 75 years and in relatively good health who participated in a 12-month clinical trial. To meet eligibility, participants were required to have had a history of at least one pre-cancerous colon polyp within the previous 3 years, a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 and no history of chronic gastrointestinal disease, colorectal cancer, or gastrointestinal surgery.

### Real World Impact And Importance of Dashboard
This data is relevant as all the above variables have implications in colorectal cancer and metabolic syndrome outcomes. These outcomes may help inform health initiatives as related to fiber intake and nutrition guidelines for the purposes of weight management and colorectal cancer.
